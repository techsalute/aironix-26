Drop a high-resolution hero image into this `public/` folder and name it `hero.jpg` (or `hero.webp`).

Usage tips:
- The CSS uses `background: url('/hero.jpg')` (see `src/App.css`). Replace that path if you use a different filename or location.
- Prefer a wide image (16:9 or wider) with center-left subject composition (robot left, text on right).
- For best results, use 1600px+ width and WebP/JPEG optimized for web.

If you want to use a different date, update the countdown target date in `src/App.js` (line with `const targetDate = new Date('February 5, YEAR')`).
